	\begin{itemize}
	\resitem{\textbf{Hariyala:} In the capacity of marketing officer managing the production department, I studied the various possibilites to reduce the overloading of motors that 
		run the chain conveyors. This resulted in the redeisgn of a certain section of the conveyor belt and also the timely rewinding of a motor. It also lead to the
	building of a ramp to ease the movement of cylinders on the work floor.}
	\resitem{\textbf{Bhitoni:} Remote Operated vales are a key component in any petroleum plant, they are particularly important in LPG plants because they let the operator close  main pipelines from remote.As an operations officer in Bhitoni I was part of the team that lead installation of ROVs on main pipelines of the plant.}

	\begin{itemize}
		\resitem{\textbf{Controllability in the 1-D:}Controllaiblity and observability are well defined for 1-D systems. It is taught in basic courses of electrical engineering everywhere. An essential part of design of any elctrical,mechanical or electromechincal sytem is to ensure that they are controllable and are stable for a known range of operating conditions}
		\resitem{\textbf{Controllablility for 2-D Discrete Systems:}The essential question when acertianing controllability of systems that are goverened by two independent parameters is the question of natural ordering. While future,past,present are obvious in 1-D systems what defines such things for the 2-D system? without such defenitions can we define controllability or observability? what can one say about a system that gives bounded output along one of the independent axes but is unbounded on the other? Such questions were taken up in the paper of Dr Jan C Willems \cite{73561}}.This paper deals with systems as a set of trajectories,which is departure from the conventional treatment of system as  black box. In subsequent times efforts were made to truly implement the idea of behavioral systems and to find universal defition to their controllability and observability. The paper by of Maria E Vlacher\cite{valcher},Zampieri \cite{zampieri},HK Pillai and D. Pal \cite{PP} are examples of the on going research in this feild. 

		two dimensional systems are an explicit example where behavioral \cite{73561}approach works and yeilds meaningful deductions for controllability and observablilty. Study of charachteristic sets is cruciual in this context because they form the part of
		defining observability and controllability for behaviorals. My thesis gives an interpretation of the conclusions in \cite{PP} which leads to a surprising result that charachteristic sets can indeed be more compactly defined than previously thought.
